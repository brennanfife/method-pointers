# Notes

& - if an ampersand goes infront of a variable, you are saying to get the address, or a pointer to that variable.

\* - An asterisk is dereference operator

## Function Pointer Receivers

- When writing a function, we can pass in arguments ether by value or by reference. Passing by value means that a copy of the value will be sent

## Nil by default

- Pointers are nil by default and should be checked before running methods on them.
